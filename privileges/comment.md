        <h3>What are comments?</h3>

<p>Comments are temporary "Post-It" notes left on a question or answer. They can be upvoted (but not downvoted) and flagged, but do not generate reputation. There's no revision history, and when they are deleted they're gone for good.</p>

<p>Please note that you can <em>always</em> comment on your own posts, and any part of your questions. However, commenting on <em>other people's</em> posts is a privilege gained from <a href="/help/whats-reputation">earning reputation</a> - if you haven't earned it yet, try to get comfortable writing answers first.</p>

<h3>How do I comment?</h3>

<p>Click the "add a comment" link under each post. Comments cannot be multi-line, so simply press enter to submit your comment.</p>

<p>Note that comments support <a href="/editing-help#comment-formatting">a small subset of Markdown</a>, so you can do things like <code>_italic_</code> and <code>**bold**</code> and <code>[named hyperlinks](https://example.com)</code></p>

<h3>What happens when I comment?</h3>

<p>The following community members will be automatically notified of your comment:</p>

<ul>
<li>the owner of the post you're commenting on</li>
<li><strong>one</strong> additional user when your comment contains a @username<sup>1</sup> reply</li>
</ul>

<p><sup>1</sup> You can only @reply to users who have already left a comment, or edited the post. The first three non-whitespace characters in @username are used for name matching, starting from the most recent comment or edit.  See <em><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/43019">How do comment replies work?</a></em></p>

<h3>When should I comment?</h3>

<p>You should submit a comment if you want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Request <strong>clarification</strong> from the author;</li>
<li>Leave <strong>constructive criticism</strong> that guides the author in improving the post;</li>
<li>Add relevant but <strong>minor or transient information</strong> to a post (e.g. a link to a related question, or an alert to the author that the question has been updated).</li>
</ul>

<h3>When <em>shouldn't</em> I comment?</h3>

<p>Comments are not recommended for any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Suggesting corrections</strong> that don't <em>fundamentally</em> change the meaning of the post; instead, <a href="/help/editing">make</a> or <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76251/how-do-suggested-edits-work">suggest</a> an edit;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Answering a question</strong> or providing an alternate solution to an existing answer; instead, post an actual answer (or edit to expand an existing one);</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compliments</strong> which do not add new information ("+1, great answer!"); instead, upvote it and <a href="/questions/how-to-answer">pay it forward</a>;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Criticisms</strong> which do not add anything constructive ("-1, see previous comments you scallywag!"); instead, downvote (and provide or upvote a better answer if appropriate);</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secondary discussion</strong> or debating a controversial point; please use <a href="https://chat.stackoverflow.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">chat</a> instead;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discussion of community behavior or site policies</strong>; please use <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">meta</a> instead.</p></li>
</ul>
